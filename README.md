# minimal-kicksecure-sys-dvm
A bash script to generate a minimal Kicksecure disposable template for QubesOS.
The generated template can also be used for sys qubes (sys-net sys-usb sys-firewall). 
I've tried to seperate and explain each step so you can further customize the script to better serve your needs.
